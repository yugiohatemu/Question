A custom circular scroll view implanted using UIView class.
The outer ring area will spin clockwise or counter clockwise based on users touch gesture and it will bounce when the user gets to the ends on either side.
The custom view only scroll when the user touches the outer area. 
See sample screen shot.

This is a very basic implementation with core graphic for drawing and NSTimer for bounce animation. Other way to do is to use OpenGl and block animation.
